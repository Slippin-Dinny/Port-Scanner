# Curently not functional

Basic port scanner tool.
The tool takes in an IP address and verifies that it is a valid IP address.
Then takes in both a minimum and maximum port number verifiying both as valid as well.
Then the tool finally procedes to scan the IP address's ports and return the open ports.


The tool is all functional with the exception of the scanning portion, it may need to be re-written or there is an error in the code I am missing as of this moment. Currently the tool will return that a port is open even when the port is not, so as of now it just goes down the range of ports regarding each one as opened.
